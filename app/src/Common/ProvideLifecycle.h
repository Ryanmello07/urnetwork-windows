// Whether this device provides while there is no tunnel session, for each
// provide control mode: the one lifecycle decision the app and the service
// both apply to the provider-only device (support inbox 1521: a provider that
// earns nothing and is told nothing).
//
// The defect this answers. The provider is the service's DeviceLocal, and that
// device existed only inside a tunnel session. Disconnect sends stop_tunnel
// (it has to: the capture routes and the firewall policy would otherwise stay
// on the machine, ConnectAction.h bug A), TunnelController::StopLocked
// destroys the DeviceLocal with the tunnel, and the launch path never starts a
// session without a Connect gesture (SdkHost::BootstrapSession, D8). So on
// Windows the provider stopped in every mode the moment the user disconnected
// and never started after a launch that did not connect. A user who picked
// Always ("provides to everyone whenever the app is running") earned only
// while connected, and Auto never served the user's own devices while idle.
//
// What the other platforms do. Android and Apple keep their packet tunnel, and
// with it the DeviceLocal, running whenever providing is enabled, and the sdk
// decides the tier. Windows keeps the DeviceLocal without the tunnel instead:
// while there is no tunnel session the service runs a provider-only device
// with no wintun adapter, no route, no DNS entry, no firewall (WFP) policy and
// no device RPC listener, so providing never changes how this machine's own
// traffic is routed, and no client can drive the device.
//
// The SDK semantics, mirrored and never reinterpreted
// (DeviceLocal.applyProvideControlModeWithLock, sdk/device_local.go):
//   never   -> no providing
//   always  -> public
//   network -> network (the user's own devices), connected or not
//   auto    -> public while connected, network while not
//   anything else -> no providing (the sdk's conservative default)
// "manual" defers to an explicitly set provide mode that lives in the device,
// which does not exist while disconnected. This app never offers it (the
// Connect page and onboarding offer auto, always, network and never), so it is
// treated like any other unknown mode and gets no provider-only device.
//
// Pure and header-only, constexpr, no Windows headers and no allocation, like
// ConnectAction.h: tools/provide-lifecycle-tests.cpp runs it on any host,
// TunnelController::StartProvider refuses with ProviderStartRefusal, and
// SdkHost::ReconcileProviderLocked asks DisconnectedProviderStep what to send.

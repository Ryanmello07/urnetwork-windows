// The insufficient-balance gate: what the connect button offers while the
// account is out of balance, and how the app reacts to entering that state.
//
// Out of balance is a billing state, not a dropped tunnel. While the SDK still
// holds a destination the service keeps the capture routes in place with no
// exit to carry them, so traffic is held in the tunnel. That is kept on
// purpose: the app never disconnects on its own, because falling back to the
// open internet without the user knowing would leak traffic outside the
// tunnel. Instead the user is told once per episode (a tray notice and the
// in-app banner) and the explicit connect button keeps a working Disconnect.
// It used to be disabled with the connect, which left the tray as the only
// way out. The round hero button is unchanged.
//
// Two decisions, kept apart (owner decision 2026-10-03: "connect with no
// balance should be blocked; however, connected and then runs out of balance
// should keep the connection active"):
//   * START CONNECT. Every connect gesture (the connect button and hero, the
//     tray's Connect, a location or peer row) is admitted only outside the
//     gate. Blocked, it starts nothing and shows the upgrade path instead.
//     SdkHost's connect entry points all pass through AdmitStartConnect, so a
//     new surface cannot skip it. Out of balance there means the latch below
//     or a fresh account balance with nothing left (DecideStartConnect), so
//     the first connect after a launch on an empty account is blocked too.
//   * ALREADY CONNECTED. A live session is never dropped for balance: the
//     reaction below never disconnects, and a reattach (app launch resuming a
//     running session, a network-server change, the service watchdog) is not
//     a connect gesture and is never gated. Disconnect is always admitted.
//
// Pure, with no Windows headers or clocks (the caller passes the time), so
// tools/balance-gate-tests.cpp
// runs it on any host with a C++20 compiler.

// reading is fed in, and once the available balance is back at
// kRecoveryThresholdBytes the connect is retried: the refused gesture runs
// again past the gate, or the held connection is rebuilt, which asks for new

//     them, and so does a connection that stays out of the block for
//     kRecoveryBudgetResetMs after a retry.
// It never connects a user who did not ask: only a refused gesture or a
// connection already requested is retried, and the user's Disconnect, a

// bump when the wire format changes incompatibly; hello negotiates it
//
// 2: StartTunnel::mode / TunnelStatus::mode + TunnelState::RpcOnly.
//    This bump is load-bearing, not bookkeeping. A version-1 service has no
//    `mode` handler in its from_json, so it SILENTLY DROPS the field: an
//    rpc-only request arrives as a plain start_tunnel, all eight steps run, and
//    the machine's routes and DNS are rewritten by a request that asked for
//    exactly the opposite. `mode` cannot be made safe by its own absence — the
//    only thing that distinguishes "this peer honours mode" from "this peer
//    ignores mode" is the version. Anything requesting RpcOnly MUST refuse to
//    proceed against a peer reporting < kFirstStartModeVersion.
//    See SdkHost::BootstrapSession.
//
//    NOT bumped for StartTunnel::kill_switch, TunnelStatus::dns_applied or
//    TunnelStatus::wfp_state, and the test is the same one that made `mode`
//    load-bearing: does silence mean the wrong thing? It does not. A peer that
//    drops kill_switch arms nothing, which is the permissive default the app
//    already claims when it has no state. A peer that drops dns_applied or
//    wfp_state is read as "DNS not applied" and "no firewall policy", i.e. the
//    DEGRADED reading — the app understates its protection rather than
//    overstating it. `mode` had to be versioned because its absence meant the
//    opposite: routes rewritten by a request that asked for none.
// 3: every live session reports the exact DeviceLocal instance and an opaque
//    RPC session generation. These fields are required for safe adoption; a
//    port match alone cannot prove that saved mTLS material belongs to the
//    listener currently bound there.
// 4: start_tunnel returns Preparing once RPC is usable. Capture is deferred
//    until the selected destination has a usable proven provider.
//
//    NOT bumped for start_provider / stop_provider or the TunnelStatus
//    provider_* fields, by the same test: does silence mean the wrong thing? It
//    does not. A service that does not know the verbs answers "unknown request
//    type" and runs nothing, which is the behaviour before they existed, and a
//    peer that drops the provider_* fields reads as "no provider-only device",
//    which claims less than the truth rather than more.
//
//    Nor for get_provider_stats: a service that does not know it answers
//    "unknown request type", which the app reads as "no statistics" and
//    renders as it did before the verb existed (no client count and no
//    provider plots while disconnected).
//
//    Nor for the network country (StartTunnel and StartProvider
//    network_country_*, set_network_country): a service that drops the fields
//    or does not know the verb sets no network country, which is the
//    behaviour before they existed, and an app too old to send them leaves a
//    new service with none.
//
//    Nor for StartTunnel::system_proxy, a diagnostic only: a service that drops
//    it writes no proxy line, and an app too old to send it gets "unknown".
//
//    Nor for upload_logs: a service that does not know it answers "unknown
//    request type", and the app falls back to what it did before the verb
//    existed (the DeviceRemote's UploadLogs while a session is bound).

// Reply::error verbatim, and the SDK's errors are whatever a remote peer, a
// resolver or a Go library produced. One stray byte in one of those is enough.
//
// error_handler_t::replace, so a bad byte degrades to U+FFFD instead of
// throwing. That is the right trade HERE and the reasoning is worth stating,
// because "never silently corrupt data" would normally point the other way:
//
//   * the field at risk is a human-readable diagnostic, and the app acts on the
//     `ok` flag and the status, not on the exact bytes of `error`. A message
//     with one replacement character in it still says everything the app needs;
//   * the alternative is not "a correct message" but NO message. dump() throws
//     from PipeServer's write path, which is a worker thread whose escape ends
//     in std::terminate — so a single malformed diagnostic string would take
//     down a LocalSystem service holding the machine's default routes;
//   * and the corruption is bounded and visible: U+FFFD in a log line reads as
//     "a byte was not valid UTF-8 here", which is true and is itself the
//     diagnosis.

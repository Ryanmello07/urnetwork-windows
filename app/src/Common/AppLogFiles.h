// The app's own log files in "send feedback with logs". The app and the service
// are separate processes, each with its own glog directory (Paths.h: the app's
// under %LOCALAPPDATA%, the service's under %ProgramData%), and the server
// keeps one zip per feedback, which the service sends (LogUpload.h). So the
// app's files ride in the service's zip, under app/ (the sdk's
// DeviceLocal.UploadLogsWithFiles).
//
// The service runs as LocalSystem and answers every signed-in user on the
// control pipe (PipeServer.cpp kPipeSddl), so it never reads a path a client
// names with its own rights. The app names its log directory (upload_logs
// app_log_dir), and the service lists and opens the glog files there while it
// acts as the app's pipe client (PipeServer::RunAsClient), so every open is
// checked against the app's own rights: the service reads nothing the app
// could not. It takes only regular files under glog names, the newest
// kMaxAppLogFiles, never through a link, and the sdk reads them only through
// duplicates of the handles, before its call returns, after which the service
// closes them. Nothing goes anywhere the upload did not go before: the same
// zip, to the same POST, within the same cap.
//
// Pure, so it is unit-tested on any host (app/tools/log-upload-tests.cpp).

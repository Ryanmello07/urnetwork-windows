// What a network peer row connects to: the location the chooser sheet's pinned
// peer section and the Network page's peers group build when one of the user's
// own devices is tapped (LocationSheets.cpp), and the name those rows and the
// connect drawer show for a peer.
//
// A peer row is one of the user's own devices (PeerViewController: connected
// and provide-enabled), so its location carries network_peer = true. The SDK
// then reaches the device as a trusted same-network peer and the connection
// egresses under the Network provide mode (sdk device_local.go). Without the
// flag the SDK takes the client id for a public exit and the connection runs
// under the Public provide mode. android
// (NetworkPeersViewModel.connectLocationForPeer) and apple
// (NetworkPeerItem.toConnectLocation) set it the same way. "Stay on this exit"
// (ProviderLocationsSheet.cpp) also connects to a client id, but to a public
// exit, and leaves it false.
//
// Header-only, WinRT-free and SDK-free: the functions are templates over the
// shapes of urnet::NetworkPeer and urnet::ConnectLocation (the generated
// urnetwork_sdk.hpp's names and types), so tools/peer-location-tests.cpp runs
// them on any host with a C++20 compiler; LocationSheets.cpp and SdkHost.cpp
// instantiate them with the real types.

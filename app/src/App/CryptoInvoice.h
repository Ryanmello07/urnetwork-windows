// The sdk's CryptoInvoiceViewController for the signed-in session (crypto-pay
// CONTRACT §4.4): the app's owner of its one native crypto invoice. The sdk
// does the work -- the quote, the countdown, the requote, the status poll and
// the invoice saved on this device -- and this store opens the controller at
// sign-in, resumes the saved invoice, runs the controller only while an
// invoice is on screen in a window that presents (no background polling,
// ZCASH.md §0.3), and publishes the controller's state as a
// cryptopay::CryptoInvoiceView.
//
// AppController owns it, as it owns SubscriptionBalanceStore, and forwards its
// changes to the window, which paints the Account rows and the open upgrade
// sheet from them (MainWindow::OnCryptoInvoiceChanged).
//
// The controller keeps the saved invoice and the device's last payment method
// in the store's own directory (StorageDir), not in the sdk's local state,
// because the C ABI does not hand the app that directory; the store empties
// its directory at sign-out, as the sdk's local state is emptied then.
//
// Threading: every public method runs on the UI thread. The sdk calls the
// change listener from its own threads; the listener only enqueues onto the UI
// queue, and the state is read there, under a generation that every open and
// close of the controller moves on, so a change queued for a controller that
// is gone is dropped.
